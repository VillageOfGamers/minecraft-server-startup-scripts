# Supported Versions

I will only support the latest version of the script at any given moment, as any updates to it are always going to be based on the latest version in the repository.

I will provide support to those who use older versions of the script, but I will not update against older revisions explicitly.

| Version       | Supported          |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Latest `main` | :white_check_mark: |
| 2.0           | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.x           | :x:                |
| 0.x           | :x:                |

# Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability or other security issue, please create an issue, or if you have a proposed fix, you may create a pull request.

At that point, one of the code reviewers for this repository will go over the new code, and make sure it fixes the problem and doesn't introduce a worse one.

If it checks out and can merge right in, it will happen.
