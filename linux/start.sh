	# This mainly applies in the case of them running the script directly via an SSH or console terminal, resulting in the script and all children listening for SIGHUP.

# This is the argument list the server starts with. I recommend ONLY changing the options in the arglist and jarname variables.
# The rest of the arguments have been fine-tuned by the Minecraft community to improve garbage collection timing.
# This results in overall better performance of the server and nearly completely removes the lag spikes you would otherwise see.

# The jarname variable specifies which file the Java runtime executes first. You generaly want this to be a RELATIVE path (i.e. "./server.jar" is a relative path).
# The -Xms#G argument specifies how much memory to allocate upon starting the Java instance.
# The -Xmx#G argument specifies the MAXIMUM amount of memory to allocate to the Java instance, NOT including overhead.
# The overhead you see on this will be around 256MB, give or take.

# I recommend leaving 1GB of RAM or more available if you are using Linux without a graphical environment.
# If you are using a desktop environment in Linux, leave 2GB of RAM or more available for the OS.
# This script is NOT usable in Windows; it is expressly designed with the Linux shell in mind.
# Please edit arglist to allocate the appropriate amount of RAM for YOUR specific system!
# The general consensus is that you shouldn't need more than 8GB of RAM unless some of your plugins are going nuts (Dynmap takes a lot for example).
# You may expand the RAM capacity further if you're REALLY wanting to stretch how much data FAWE (or normal WorldEdit) can hold in the buffer at one time.
# Also see the comments for fullarglist below; these tips are necessary!
