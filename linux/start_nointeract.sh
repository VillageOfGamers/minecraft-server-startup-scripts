# This variable directly specifies whether or not to enable the script's Download Mode logic.
# If this variable is set to 0, this script will NOT check for or download new server JAR releases.
# This also means that this script CANNOT ask to re-enable this function if it is disabled here!
# However, if this toggle is enabled, as per default, you MAY disable it via prompts during execution.
# All of those prompts will ONLY disable Download Mode on a PER-RUN BASIS however! It will NOT be permanent!
download=1

# This is the path to the server itself. I recommend having this be an absolute path.
# The reason I have it showing "./" is to point it to the "current" directory.
# This means it will evaluate the server to be located inside the directory you get if you run pwd just before this script.
# This is a sensible default, as the script is designed to check if the variable is the default.
# If this variable is not the default, the script has a check in place to see if the initial working directory actually holds the server.
# The script will complain to you if that happens and this variable is not "./", but it will allow you to continue still.
serverdir="./"

# This is the argument list the server starts with. I recommend ONLY changing the options in the arglist and jarname variables.
# The rest of the arguments have been fine-tuned by the Minecraft community to improve garbage collection timing.
# This results in overall better performance of the server and nearly completely removes the lag spikes you would otherwise see.

# The jarname variable specifies which file the Java runtime executes first. You generaly want this to be a RELATIVE path (i.e. "./server.jar" is a relative path).
# The -Xms#G argument specifies how much memory to allocate upon starting the Java instance.
# The -Xmx#G argument specifies the MAXIMUM amount of memory to allocate to the Java instance, NOT including overhead.
# The overhead you see on this will be around 256MB, give or take.

# I recommend leaving 1GB of RAM or more available if you are using Linux without a graphical environment.
# If you are using a desktop environment in Linux, leave 2GB of RAM or more available for the OS.
# This script is NOT usable in Windows; it is expressly designed with the Linux shell in mind.
# Please edit arglist to allocate the appropriate amount of RAM for YOUR specific system!
# The general consensus is that you shouldn't need more than 8GB of RAM unless some of your plugins are going nuts (Dynmap takes a lot for example).
# You may expand the RAM capacity further if you're REALLY wanting to stretch how much data FAWE (or normal WorldEdit) can hold in the buffer at one time.
# Also see the comments for fullarglist below; these tips are necessary!
jarname="./server.jar"
arglist="-Xms16G -Xmx16G -jar $jarname"

# THESE VARIABLES ARE NOT TO BE TOUCHED UNLESS YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
# These arguments for the Java instance have been hand-tuned by the Minecraft community to provide optimal performance of the server.
# The user-adjustable argument list is ABOVE these comment lines; those control how much RAM it can use, and the name of the JAR to launch.
