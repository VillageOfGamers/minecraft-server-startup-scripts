# Minecraft Server Startup Scripts

This is a collection of shell-based scripts designed to start up a Minecraft server, as well as perform sanity checks to ensure everything operates smoothly.

Shellscript version currently written to support BASH, DASH, ZSH, KSH, and ASH! A Windows PowerShell version has been finally made and is guaranteed to work on PowerShell 7 under Windows!

Unfortunately, I have not yet had a chance or opportunity to test the script under Windows PowerShell 5, or PowerShell 7 under Linux/MacOS at this time.

If you would like to contribute to the PowerShell script to help detect which OS you're on so that it can adapt and work correctly, please submit a pull request!

Feel free to submit a PR if any changes need to be made for other shell types that you guys happen to use! So far, the Linux shell script is 100% POSIX-compliant!

The mcrcon/LICENSE file specifies the copyright that applies to the included mcrcon CLI client for Linux and Windows machines. You can find it at: https://github.com/Tiiffi/mcrcon

These files are available in the mcrcon directory in the root of the project. These will definitely help for those who wish to use this as a background service!
