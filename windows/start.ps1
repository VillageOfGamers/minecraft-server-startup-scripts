# This variable directly specifies whether or not to enable the script's Download Mode logic.
# If this variable is set to $false, this script will NOT check for or download new server JAR releases.
# This also means that this script CANNOT ask to re-enable this function if it is disabled here!

# This is the path to the server itself. I recommend having this be an absolute path.
# The reason I have it showing ".\" is to point it to the "current" directory.
# This means it will evaluate the server to be located inside the directory you get if you run pwd just before this script.
# This is a sensible default, as the script is designed to check if the variable is the default.
# If this variable is not the default, the script has a check in place to see if the initial working directory actually holds the server.
# The script will complain to you if that happens and this variable is not ".\", but it will allow you to continue still.

# This is the argument list the server starts with. I recommend ONLY changing the options in the arglist and jarname variables.
# The rest of the arguments have been fine-tuned by the Minecraft community to improve garbage collection timing.
# This results in overall better performance of the server and nearly completely removes the lag spikes you would otherwise see.

# The jarname variable specifies which file the Java runtime executes first. You generaly want this to be a RELATIVE path (i.e. "./server.jar" is a relative path).
# The -Xms#G argument specifies how much memory to allocate upon starting the Java instance.
# The -Xmx#G argument specifies the MAXIMUM amount of memory to allocate to the Java instance, NOT including overhead.
# The overhead you see on this will be around 256MB, give or take.
# The general consensus is to keep these 2 the same, it just makes life easier as it allows the JVM to not have to deallocate and reallocate memory constantly.

# I recommend leaving 1GB of RAM or more available if you are using Linux without a graphical environment.
# If you are using a desktop environment in Linux, leave 2GB of RAM or more available for the OS.
# This script has been tested in Windows using PowerShell 7. It has NOT been tested with older PowerShell versions or under UNIX OSes with PowerShell 7.
# Please edit arglist to allocate the appropriate amount of RAM for YOUR specific system!
# The general consensus is that you shouldn't need more than 8GB of RAM unless some of your plugins are going nuts (Dynmap takes a lot for example).
# You may expand the RAM capacity further if you're REALLY wanting to stretch how much data FAWE (or normal WorldEdit) can hold in the buffer at one time.
# Also see the comments for fullarglist below; these tips are necessary!

$arglist="-Xms16G -Xmx16G -jar $jarname"

# This variable is explicitly here JUST to provide a way to not use the already-installed JRE environment if you do not want to use it.
# This is especially useful if you cannot fully install the JRE you wish to use, but you can run it from a different location.
# Otherwise you may leave it set to "java.exe" to use your currently installed version of Java, rather than having to specify a full path.
# WARNING: YOU MUST BE USING JAVA 16 OR LATER! IT WILL BREAK OTHERWISE! THIS IS NOT HYPERBOLE; I HAVE TRIED TO USE OLDER JAVA VERSIONS AND IT DOES NOT WORK!
